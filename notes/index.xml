primary concern: are experts correctly identified? common interests model: voters receive independent signals; ex ante equal prob one of two values common objective: identify state correctly via majority vote signal precision (probability of correctness) varies across individuals experts publicly identified, precision of their signals public info voter precision private info, weakly lower than experts if voter delegates, vote is randomly assigned to one of the experts (weird) theoretical results equilibrium w/ positive delegation that dominates majority voting w/o delegation.</description></item><item><title>ðŸ’Š Decidim (metagov seminar)</title><link>https://mwalton.me/notes/mg-sem-decim/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mwalton.me/notes/mg-sem-decim/</guid><description>Background why digital tools for democracy need to be developed democratically decidim.org decidim github decidim social contract Meeting Notes speaker: Arnau Montarde free, open source democratic platform in Barcelona for citizen participation context: why decidim?</description></item><item><title>Anticipatory Innovation Governance</title><link>https://mwalton.me/notes/innovation-gov/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mwalton.me/notes/innovation-gov/</guid><description>Observatory of Public Sector Innovation: Anticipatory Innovation Governance
reactive governance approach is ineffective at handling rapidly evolving crises anticipatory innovation governance (AIG) aims to actively explore possible futures, experiment w/ policy to enact them and iteratively learn what to incorporate into a broader governance system not only create knowledge anticipating the future, but jointly shape and prepare for it, making dynamic adjustments along the way disruptive tech transforming production and distribution; changing status quo for economies and societies resulting in new inequalities future of employment skills income distribution trade wellbeing &amp;ldquo;action must start with the willingness to embrace radical uncertainty&amp;rdquo; collingride dilemma: trade off between clearly understanding the impact of a technology on society vs ease of influence over social, political and innovation trajectory when change is easy: need for it cannot be clearly foreseen when need for change is apparent: change becomes difficult, expensive and time consuming !</description></item><item><title>Stochastic Parrots Day ðŸ¦œ (DAIR)</title><link>https://mwalton.me/notes/dair-stochastic-parrots/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mwalton.me/notes/dair-stochastic-parrots/</guid><description>![[notes/images/stochastic-parrots.png]]

Ideas an interesting modeling approach could be combining an LM that converses with users encouraging them to introspect on their values combined w/ a theory of mind that the model constructs (and persists) of them between use sessions (this could also get quite dark) i like the idea of trying to align recommenders w/ what users actually value, however I&amp;rsquo;m concerned about how the existing incentive structure (advertising / attention economy / surveillance capitalism) will incorporate research in this area.</description></item></channel></rss>
