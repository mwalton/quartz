reactive governance approach is ineffective at handling rapidly evolving crises anticipatory innovation governance (AIG) aims to actively explore possible futures, experiment w/ policy to enact them and iteratively learn what to incorporate into a broader governance system not only create knowledge anticipating the future, but jointly shape and prepare for it, making dynamic adjustments along the way disruptive tech transforming production and distribution; changing status quo for economies and societies resulting in new inequalities future of employment skills income distribution trade wellbeing &amp;ldquo;action must start with the willingness to embrace radical uncertainty&amp;rdquo; collingride dilemma: trade off between clearly understanding the impact of a technology on society vs ease of influence over social, political and innovation trajectory when change is easy: need for it cannot be clearly foreseen when need for change is apparent: change becomes difficult, expensive and time consuming !</description></item><item><title>Stochastic Parrots Day 🦜 (DAIR)</title><link>https://mwalton.me/notes/dair-stochastic-parrots/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mwalton.me/notes/dair-stochastic-parrots/</guid><description>![[notes/images/stochastic-parrots.png]]

Ideas an interesting modeling approach could be combining an LM that converses with users encouraging them to introspect on their values combined w/ a theory of mind that the model constructs (and persists) of them between use sessions (this could also get quite dark) i like the idea of trying to align recommenders w/ what users actually value, however I&amp;rsquo;m concerned about how the existing incentive structure (advertising / attention economy / surveillance capitalism) will incorporate research in this area.</description></item></channel></rss>
