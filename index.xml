Ideas an interesting modeling approach could be combining an LM that converses with users encouraging them to introspect on their values combined w/ a theory of mind that the model constructs (and persists) of them between use sessions (this could also get quite dark) i like the idea of trying to align recommenders w/ what users actually value, however I&amp;rsquo;m concerned about how the existing incentive structure (advertising / attention economy / surveillance capitalism) will incorporate research in this area.</description></item><item><title># Hunting for naval mines with deep neural networks</title><link>https://mwalton.me/cv/pubs/mlo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mwalton.me/cv/pubs/mlo/</guid><description>Daniel Gebhardt, Keyur Parikh, Iryna Dzieciuch, Michael Walton, Nhut Anh Vo Hoang
