Ideas an interesting modeling approach could be combining an LM that converses with users encouraging them to introspect on their values combined w/ a theory of mind that the model constructs (and persists) of them between use sessions (this could also get quite dark) i like the idea of trying to align recommenders w/ what users actually value, however I&amp;rsquo;m concerned about how the existing incentive structure (advertising / attention economy / surveillance capitalism) will incorporate research in this area.</description></item></channel></rss>
