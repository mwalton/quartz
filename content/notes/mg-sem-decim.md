- [public code](https://publiccode.eu/en/)
	- Why is software created using taxpayersâ€™ money not released as Free Software?
	- We want legislation requiring that publicly financed software developed for the public sector be made publicly available under aÂ [Free and Open Source Software](https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/ "Free Software gives everybody the right to use, study, share and improve software. This right helps support other fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech, press and privacy.")Â licence. If it is public money, it should be public code as well.
	- **Code paid by the people should be available to the people!**
