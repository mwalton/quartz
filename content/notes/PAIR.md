[Intentional ignorance is a value-laden choice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcE6_NPjvuo), Margaret Mitchell
- choice of dataset and curation define what is important
- model selection encodes additional bias
- generation of new data from users interacting with the model generates a bias feedback loop
- over and underrepresentation of subpopulations encode value judgements
- **foresight** is critical:
	- intended use / users
	- foreseeable use / users
	- foreseeable discriminatory uses
	- risks
	- foreseeable harms
	- foreseeable disproportionate harms
- "I'm just an engineer / data scientist" is willful ignorance; inflicts foreseeable harm
