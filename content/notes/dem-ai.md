## [Democratising AI: Multiple Meanings, Goals, and Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12642)
- Defines four modalities of "democratization":
	- Use:
		- reducing the costs of acquiring and running AI tools
		- providing intuitive interfaces to facilitate human-AI interaction w/o extensive training or technical skills
	- Development:
		- model, code & data sharing
		- compute access
		- project support & coordination
		- education & upskilling
	- Profits:
		- avoid widening socioeconomic divide between leading & lagging nations
		- ease financial burden of job loss to automation
	- Governance:
		- decisions on usage, development and profit reflect interests and preferences of impacted peoples
		- decentralizing control away from big tech
		- normative cross-cultural questions
		- ensuring benefits and burdens distributed fairly
- May conflict (eg governance may restrict use or governance)
- democratization =/= dissemination
- positive value of AI democratization rooted in how well the effort **reflects interests and values** of impacted stakeholders
