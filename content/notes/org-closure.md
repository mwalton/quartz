Notes on [A Study of “Organizational Closure” and Autopoiesis](https://harishsnotebook.wordpress.com/2019/07/21/a-study-of-organizational-closure-and-autopoiesis/)

- cybernetics as study of systems open to energy, but closed to information and control aka 'information-tightness'. (weird)
- autopoietic organization: self-producing, process which generate own components
- system's response is determined by structure; response may be triggered by an environmental event but does not follow causally from the external event
	- behavior of system is not specified or controlled by environment
- *structural coupling* between system and environment (contains other systems): mutual sources of perturbation triggering state changes in one another
- argues that observation of "adaptation to environment" is in fact structural "drift" as the system responds to successive perturbations following own-structure at each moment
	- arguing in RL parlance: a policy is not self-producing; it is a product of some process external to itself (the learning algorithm from which it is derived)
	- an "autopoetic policy" would consist of an online learning algorithm which adapts to environmental perturbations following structural rules entirely internal to itself
- organizational change only effective through changing rules of behavior (organization) first then processes / routines / procedures (structure)
