- Cooperism
	- cooperism: ambition to build power through cooperation
	- protecting the environment, abolition of punitive paradigms & creating democratic self-governance
	- concentrated combined and compounded cooperation becomes cooperism generating co-power towards "cooperation democracy"
	- building on existing cooperative forms and organizations to connect them and compete with other approaches in the current political economy
	- replace punitive paradigm with cooperative paradigm

- New models / theories of cooperation
	- finding forms that enable democratic self-governance
	- many cooperatives are profit driven, many non-profits are hierarchical / corporate models
- [Mondragon](https://www.mondragon-corporation.com/en/)
- decks are stacked against cooperation (tax codes, subsidies, VC etc)
- "we don't have time to prove cooperation trumps competition (in other species)"
- cooperation is a matter of choice, evaluated under different (pro-social) metrics
