[Observatory of Public Sector Innovation: Anticipatory Innovation Governance](https://oecd-opsi.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AnticipatoryInnovationGovernance-Note-Nov2020.pdf?curius=2726)
- reactive governance approach is ineffective at handling rapidly evolving crises
- anticipatory innovation governance (AIG) aims to actively explore possible futures, experiment w/ policy to enact them and iteratively learn what to incorporate into a broader governance system
- not only create knowledge anticipating the future, but jointly shape and prepare for it, making dynamic adjustments along the way
- disruptive tech transforming production and distribution; changing status quo for economies and societies resulting in new inequalities
	- future of employment
	- skills
	- income distribution
	- trade
	- wellbeing
- "action must start with the willingness to embrace radical uncertainty"
- collingride dilemma: trade off between clearly understanding the impact of a technology on society vs ease of influence over social, political and innovation trajectory
- when change is easy: need for it cannot be clearly foreseen
- when need for change is apparent: change becomes difficult, expensive and time consuming

- govt can only address rapidly evolving tech w/ a deep knoledge in the early stages and understanding potential impacts while evolving policy in tandem
- exploring numerous possible futures allows govts to avoid lock-in to a single path
- crises can act as focusing events
	- relies on chance rather than intention
	- ad-hoc and not systemic practice
- growing gap between legal and ethical oversight evident
	- autonomous cars
	- cyber security
	- social media platforms
- govts should experiment in real world envs w/ small groups affected by policy interventions to learn effects
- embrace uncertainty, explore possible futures, steer towards preferred ones
- done iteratively and w/ intention, can shape the system toward deisreable futures
- must be done intentionally and persistently
- dominant systems will tend to crowd out or deprioritize anticipatory innovation as part of portfolio activities
- "human sensor network": citizen feedback loops and sensemaking process integrated into governance
- safe-to-fail project portfolios
- pick up weak and strong signals of potential futures, engage w/ signals before a new paradigm is locked-in
- involve diverse stakeholders around plausible, possible & preferred futures
- "innovation stewardship"
