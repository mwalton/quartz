[Queer In AI: A Case Study in Community-Led Participatory AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16972)

- highlights representational and allocational harms to to brittle representations
- narrow conceptualizations of fairness assumes queer identities known, observable, measurable, discrete & static
- Participatory methods address limitations by involving users as co-designers
- Reflexivity in participatory methods encourages transparency during design
- participation should not be mediated by companies developing AI, shift decision-making & design power to marginalized groups
## Core Principles
1. Participation and Decentralization
	- hierarchy poses problems:
		- fails to reflect diversity of community
		- high-profile organizers face targeted harassment campaigns
2. Participation and Intersectionality
3. Participation and Community Leadership
	- community informed: incorporate lived experience to guide research questions, data collection & data interpretation
	- community involved: decision making & research planning
	- community led: research seen not only as a process to create knowledge but also educated and mobilize action
