- we encounter daily inconveniences that are result of design process decisions
- "A good tool is an invisible tool. By invisible, we mean that the tool does not intrude on your consciousness; you focus on the task, not the tool." -- Mark Weiser
- "pass-through technologies"
- sites of governance: environments in which one cannot control experience / has a loss of agency due to design (music in supermarket, ambient lighting in brand clothing store, "vegas project" 20min loop)
- Solution (for employees exposed to music loops): Brian Eno's music for airports
- Books: Design of Everyday things, Design for a better world
- PetNet: automated pet feeder
	- food chute jams w/o notifying user
	- feeding logic is handled remotely; when server crashes, pets get no food
	- PetNet not held responsible for service failures
- Calm technology (Mark Weiser, John Seeley Brown)
- Designing Calm Technology
	1. Invisible
		- Technology shouldn't require all of our attention, just some of it, and only when necessary
		- ambient awareness & peripheral attention
	2. Reliable: works even when it fails
	3. Technology should amplify the best of technology and the best of humanity
- Chronos (amount of time, specific time) vs Kairos (subjective moment / season) time
	- two ways of considering time and how we act within it
	- what kids of tools give us back our Kairos time vs tools which use all our attention (push us into Chronos time)
- Calm technology as a governing body
	- economic incentives for good design
	- humans alongside technology
- "Dictator in your pocket"
	- controls time
	- attention
	- amygdala
- [One Sec](https://one-sec.app/) 
- What causes conflict? sharp gradients
	- Calm technology is a gradient softener
	- softening gradients make for more stable systems
	- longer term products
	- new opportunities to make things
