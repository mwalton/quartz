- calls into question vague definitions of ML as value-neutral
- annotation of papers to reveal "values":
	- justification for choice of project
	- which attributes of project uplift / advertised
	- consideration of potential negative consequences
	- institutional affiliation & funding
- societal need: 15%, discuss negative potential: 1%
- 59 values codified
- most common: performance, generalization, quantitative evidence, efficiency, building on past work, novelty
- textual evidence demonstrating values reflect assumptions & implication supporting centralization of power
- contributions
	1. [open source annotation scheme](https://github.com/wagnew3/The-Values-Encoded-in-Machine-Learning-Research) for studying values in documents
	2. apply to 100 influential ML papers
	3. textual analysis to understand operationalization of values
	4. quantitative analysis of affiliations & funding of influential papers
- *justificatory chain*: chain of reasoning for technical / societal need to motivate contribution

- papers typically motivated by needs of ML research community, rarely mention societal benefit
- societal needs mentioned w/o much justification
- connection to need often only discussed at beginning
- potential harms rarely discussed, often hypothetical
- analysis indicates operationalization based on value-laden assumptions ![[notes/images/social-need-harm.png]]
