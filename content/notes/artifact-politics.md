- machines, structures & systems analyzed the ways in which they embody forms of power and authority
- authoritarian technologies: system-centered, powerful, unstable
- democratic technologies: human-centered, weak, resourceful & durable
- Environmentalist Denis Hayes' example: dispersed solar more compatible w/ social equity, freedom & cultural pluralism vs nuclear power
> Scarcely a new invention comes along that someone does not proclaim it the salvation of a free society
- one need not appeal to conspiracy or malicious intent: social processes of scientific knowledge, technological invention and corporate profit reinforce goals of political and economic power
> The things we call "technologies" are ways of building order in our world. Many technical devices and systems important in everyday life contain possibilities for many different ways of ordering human activity. Consciously or not, deliberately or inadvertently, societies choose structures for technologies that influence how people are going to work, communicate, travel, consume, and so forth over a very long time.
- design choices become fixed in material equipment, economic investment and social habit & loose flexibility once implemented
- similar to legislation: establish a framework for social order (how people work, communicate, consume, travel etc.)
> The issues that divide or unite people in society are settled not only in the institutions and practices of politics proper, but also, and less obviously, in tangible arrangements of steel and concrete, wires and transistors, nuts and bolts.
- eschewing more readily measurable effects of employment, income, environmental impact etc. a fundamental concern is raised for the consequences of technology on the form human associations
- nuclear weapons as inherently political artifacts: as long as the bomb exists, its extreme lethality necessitates centralized, rigid hierarchical control
- interesting observation: people tend to accept changes due to technology w/ little scrutiny but strongly resist changes based on political grounds
	- could this be because they are afforded (possibly illusory) choice in the first place?
	- if non-experts were empowered / involved in the development of a technology, might the mere opportunity for engagement encourage them to have stronger opinions / think critically?
