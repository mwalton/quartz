[LLMs, Innovation, and Capitalism](https://joinreboot.org/p/llms-capitalism)
- increased corporate gatekeeping motivated by capital, not "ai safety"
- advocates for open science; closed models shape & constrain what ai gets built and whose interests considered
- closed model is on the take from open source research
- main barriers to large model research:
	- economic / resource constraints
	- lack of access to models themselves
- closed models incentivizes / necessitates duplication of effort (eg open reproductions or corporate peers building their own closed competing models)
- risk and ethics only considered to the extent that they protect profits (minimizing "reputational risk")
- highlights ethical considerations around LLM privileging english speakers, exploitative labor practices & environmental costs
- community can discourage closed development through a [reproducibility requirement](https://hackingsemantics.xyz/2023/closed-baselines/)
