## Collective Intelligence Ideas
1. bayesian model of agent delegation strategies in liquid democracies
	- agents in a voting pool assess one another based on 1. alignment with own values 2. competence
	- utility function associated with delegating to each prospective player
	- agents either 1. vote according to their own value fn 2. delegate given by competence-weighted value divergence
1. formal definitions of a bellman-esque objective embedded within a model of the entity or organization engaged in its development.
2. [[cv/pubs/dac-rl|distributed consensus algorithms]] interoperable w/ human input. (decentralizing a meta policy by agents voting according to value function)
3. DeliberativeÂ democratic / [[thoughts/participatory-design|participatory design]] mechanisms (reading a lot of [Aviv Ovadya's](https://aviv.me/) recent work)
