In conversation with [The UN Tech Envoy](https://www.un.org/techenvoy/) and [Areeq Chowdhury](https://www.csap.cam.ac.uk/network/areeq-chowdhury/): Panelists discussed viewing AI from a human rights lens, risks of weaponization and policy diversity to respect societal context. The speakers advocated for cross-functional governance and human-rights focused, independent algorithmic impacts assessments. ML is high-impact and high risk enough to have collaboration trump competition.
