Participatory design (PD) is the active involvement of users in the design of some system, product or process. It is a [[thoughts/democracy|democratic]] approach to designing social and technological systems that involve  interaction with humans. PD approaches are premised on the belief that users ought to participate in the design of systems they will ultimately use. PD aims to ensure that all stakeholders, with a particular emphasis on end users, have equal opportunity to contribute to the systems' design.
