Participatory design (PD) is the active involvement of users in the design of some system, product or process. It is a [[thoughts/democracy|democratic]] approach to designing social and technological systems that involve  interaction with humans. PD approaches are premised on the belief that users ought to participate in the design of systems they will ultimately use. PD aims to ensure that all stakeholders, with a particular emphasis on end users, have equal opportunity to contribute to the systems' design.

Many efforts have been made to incorporate user feedback and preferences in ML models (eg recommenders, RLHF: reinforcement learning from human feedback) however the application of *democratic* participation *at scale* to the entirety of the design process *end-to-end*, to my knowledge, has not been accomplished. It ~~should~~ needs to be.

# Notes
[PAIR 2020: Intentional ignorance is a value-laden choice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcE6_NPjvuo)
- choice of dataset and curation define what is important
- model selection encodes additional bias
- generation of new data from users interacting with the model generates a bias feedback loop
- over and underrepresentation of subpopulations encode value judgements
- **foresight** is critical:
	- intended use / users
	- foreseeable use / users
	- foreseeable discriminatory uses
	- risks
	- foreseeable harms
	- foreseeable disproportionate harms
- "I'm just an engineer / data scientist" is willful ignorance; inflicts foreseeable harm
