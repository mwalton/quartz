I was greatly inspired by Jacky Zhao's approach to [Networked Thought](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought/) and decided to build my own garden using their excellent [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) project. Thanks Jacky! Check out some other awesome gardens built on Quartz [here](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/showcase/).

## Building in the open

> *One who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but they also occasionally get clues as to what the world is and what might be important.* â€” Richard Hamming
