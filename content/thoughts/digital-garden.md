I was greatly inspired by Jacky Zhao's approach to [Networked Thought](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought/) and decided to build my own garden using their excellent [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) project. Thanks Jacky! Check out some other awesome gardens built on Quartz [[notes/showcase|here]].

## Building in the open
