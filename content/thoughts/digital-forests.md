In early 2023, I was inspired by Jacky Zhao's approach to [Networked Thought](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought/) and decided to build my own garden using their excellent [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) project. (Thanks Jacky!) Much to my dismay, however, the manicured garden of ideas I'd envisioned quickly got overgrown with random weeds, #TODOs and tangents. The tension between the newfound freedom of loosly structured note-taking and the desire to just get things done left me discouraged and frustrated. For a while I tried to shore up the structure, but ultimately I've accepted that I'm most productively at ease here when I just let my thoughts rewild.

Now I think of my process more like managing a forest I have no hope of fully taming rather than tending a delicate garden.
