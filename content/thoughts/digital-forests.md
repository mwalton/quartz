In early 2023, I was inspired by Jacky Zhao's approach to [Networked Thought](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought/) and decided to start my own garden using their excellent [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) project. (Thanks Jacky!)

Much to my dismay, however, the manicured garden of ideas I'd envisioned quickly got overgrown with random weeds, #TODOs , tangles and tangents. The tension between the newfound freedom of digital gardens and the desire to just get things done left me discouraged and frustrated. For a while I tried to shore up the structure, but ultimately I've accepted that I'm most productively at ease here when I just let my thinking rewild. Rather than tending a delicate garden, I like to think of the research process like managing a forest I have no hope of fully taming.

## Stewarding the Dark Forest [ðŸŒ²](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy1qUMvicCY)
In the physical world, there is a complex relationship between land *development* and land *stewardship*. For my purposes I think of land *development* as 'changing the landscape for a utilitarian purpose, like agriculture or housing'. 

Similarly, in the virtual world, the language we often use to describe the roles we play and the methods we use are a reflection of our values (eg the creation of software artifacts is carried out under the title *[developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhh_GeBPOhs&ab_channel=MrWueb007)*)

Stewardship, however is more nuanced. Its definition is always context-dependent but a consistent theme is *caring* for a piece of land, regardless of its ownership; caring about the biodiversity of species that belong to the land; its people, their culture and their customs.

Are the beings that people the internet healthy? happy? thriving? What does good stewardship look like on the complex frontiers of our virtual world? What practices engender _care_ for the health and wellbeing of the planetary cyber-physical systems our technologies shape?
