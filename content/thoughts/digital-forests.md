In early 2023, I was inspired by Jacky Zhao's approach to [Networked Thought](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought/) and decided to build my own garden using their excellent [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) project. (Thanks Jacky!)

Much to my dismay, however, the manicured garden of ideas I'd envisioned quickly got overgrown with random weeds, #TODOs and tangents. The tension between the newfound freedom of loosly structured note-taking and the desire to just get things done left me discouraged and frustrated. For a while I tried to shore up the structure, but ultimately I've accepted that I'm most productively at ease here when I just let my thinking rewild. Rather than tending a delicate garden, I like to think of the research process like exploring and managing a forest I have no hope of fully taming.

## Stewarding the Dark Forest
In the physical world, there is a complex relationship between land *development* and land *stewardship*. For my purposes I think of *development* as 'changing landforms for a utilitarian purpose, like agriculture or housing'. 

Stewardship, however is more nuanced. Its definition is always context-dependent but a consistent theme is *caring* for a piece of land, regardless of its ownership; caring about the biodiversity of species that belong to the land; its people, their culture and their customs.

Similarly, in the virtual world, the language we often use to describe the roles we play and the methods we use are a reflection of our values (eg the creation of software artifacts is carried out under the title *[developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhh_GeBPOhs&ab_channel=MrWueb007)*)

For all our technical accomplishments, are the beings that people the internet healthy? happy? thriving? What does good stewardship look like on the complex frontiers of our virtual world? What practices engender _care_ for the health and wellbeing of the planetary cyber-physical systems our technologies shape?
