In the physical world, there is a complex relationship between land *development* and land *stewardship*. Definitions vary (and often stewardship implys some form of development) but for our purposes we'll follow the wikipedia-level defintion and refer to *development* as 'changing landforms from a natural or semi-natural state for a purpose, such as agriculture or housing'. 

Stewardship, however is more nuanced. Its definition is context-dependent but the unifying theme is *caring* for a piece of land, regardless of its ownership. Caring about all the biodiverse species that belong to the land; its people, their culture and their customs.

Similarly, in the virtual world, the language technologists use to describe the roles we play and the methods we use are a reflection of our values. Today, the art and science of creating software artifacts is carried out primarily under the title *[developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhh_GeBPOhs&ab_channel=MrWueb007)*.

Contrary to commonly incentivised strategies of unfettered growth, development and disruption; what might it look like to _care_ for health of the planetary cyberphysical system our technologies shape? For all our progress, are the diverse beings that people the internet healthy? happy? thriving?

Below are some thoughts on how we might evolve into better *stewards* of our shared virtual ecosystem.
