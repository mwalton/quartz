# Ideas
- an interesting modeling approach could be combining an LM that converses with users encouraging them to introspect on their values combined w/ a theory of mind that the model constructs (and persists) of them between use sessions (this could also get quite dark)
- i like the idea of trying to align reccomenders w/ what users actually value, *however* I'm concerned about how the existing incentive structure (advertising / attention economy / surveillance capitalism) will incorporate research in this area. For instance: one solution could involve: gather more data to discern more intimate information about users; which requires additional surveillance and could further drive nefarious attempts to *manipulate* values (ala how maximizing ad revenue leads to feedback loops that manipulate preferences)

# Notes
[Values, Preferences & Meaningful Choice](https://github.com/jxe/vpm/blob/master/vpm.pdf)
- central argument: what an agent chooses to attend to in order to make a choice leading up to making a choice (their attentional policy) reveals more about their values than the choice itself (the revealed preference)
- revealed preferences: simple, universally applicable, robust, and highresolution
- users can be lead astray / choose something w/o serving their interests when only tracking revealed preferences / engagement metrics
- non-introspective agents can still (often) express a preference
- constitutive attentional policies fall short in that they:
	- require more introspection
	- require more articulicy
	- are harder to verify
- Suggested research directions:
	- rich, interactive experiences to uncover CAPs
	- infer CAPs from data
	- visualizations & crypotography to make CAPs understandible, auditable and legimitate

- revealed preferences assumed independent variables. are dependent variables due induced feedback loop
