Welcome traveler! You've wandered into my humble [[thoughts/digital-forests|forest of ideas]]!

I wear a few different hats in my current role as a fellow with [xD](https://www.xd.gov/) @ [The US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/en.html). Notably, our team is working on frameworks for responsible operationalization of AI, experimenting with improving the user experience of [Model Cards](https://bias.xd.gov/) for government use cases and developing new methods for algorithmic auditing using privacy enhancing technologies.

Partially motivated by my prior work in [[cv/pubs/dac-rl|multi-agent systems]], [[cv/pubs/tom-rl|reinforcement learning]] & [[cv/pubs/rl-openspiel|game theory]] I'm also reflecting on intelligent behavior in nature through the parallel lens of artificial systems with short personal [essays](https://autopoiesis.substack.com/). I live on a [[thoughts/farm|farm]] in central Washington where I find constant inspiration from the diversity of life I'm grateful to be immersed in.

Here are some paths you might follow to get to know me, my research and interests:

- [[cv/current_doings|üå± greenhouse]]: current doings, musings and evolving ideas.
- [[cv/projects|üå≤ arboretum]]: projects that I'm happy to say took root.
- [[books/_booklist|üçÉ tea garden]]: curated reading list. grab some üçµ and enjoy!
