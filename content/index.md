Welcome traveler! You've wandered into my humble [[thoughts/digital-forests|forest of ideas]]!

I wear a lot of hats in my current role as an emerging technologies fellow with [xD](https://www.xd.gov/) @ [The US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/en.html). Notably, my team is experimenting with improving the user experience of [Model Cards](https://www.xd.gov/blog/creating-a-client-side-model-card-generator/) for government use cases and developing new methods for algorithmic auditing using privacy enhancing technologies.

I'm also creatively exploring parallels between intelligent behavior in natural and artificial systems through short personal essays on [Autopoiesis](https://autopoiesis.substack.com/). My prior work has focused on related topics in multi-agent reinforcement learning and game theory.
