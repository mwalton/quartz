Welcome traveler! You've wandered into my humble [[thoughts/digital-forests|forest of ideas]]! 

I am deeply committed to researching and imagining emerging technologies that serve the public good. Integral to this work is a vision for AI where access, use, and governance are safe, sustainable, and equitable. I doggedly believe a better collective future is possible.

In my current role as a fellow with [xD](https://www.xd.gov/) @ [The US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/en.html) our team is working on frameworks for responsible AI, experimenting with improving the user experience of [Model Cards](https://bias.xd.gov/) for government use cases and developing novel methods for algorithmic auditing using privacy enhancing technologies.

Partially motivated by my prior work in [[cv/pubs/dac-rl|multi-agent systems]], [[cv/pubs/tom-rl|reinforcement learning]] & [[cv/pubs/rl-openspiel|game theory]] I'm also creatively exploring intelligent behavior in nature through the lens of artificial systems with short personal [essays](https://autopoiesis.substack.com/). I live on a farm in Washington where I find constant inspiration from the diversity of life I'm grateful to be immersed in.

Here are some paths you might follow to get to know me, my research and interests:
