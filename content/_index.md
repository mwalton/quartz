Welcome traveler! You've stumbled into my humble [[thoughts/digital-garden |garden of ideas]]!

> *The idea is like grass. It craves light, likes crowds, thrives on crossbreeding, grows better for being stepped on.* —Ursula K. Le Guin

I'm a researcher (primarily focused on multi-agent reinforcement learning) currently experimenting with improving [[thoughts/participatory-design|public participation]] in the design & [[thoughts/alignment|alignment of artificial intelligence]] with social progress and the emerging potential of human [[thoughts/ci |collective intelligence]].

Here are some paths you might follow to get to know me, my research and interests:

- [[cv/doings|🌱 greenhouse]]: current doings, musings and evolving ideas.
- [[cv/projects|🌲 arboretum]]: projects that I'm happy to say took root.
- [[books/_booklist|🍃 tea garden]]: curated reading list. grab some 🍵 and enjoy!
