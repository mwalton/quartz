Welcome traveler! You've stumbled into my humble [[thoughts/digital-garden |garden of thought]]!

I'm a researcher currently exploring [[thoughts/participatory-ai|participatory methods]] and [[thoughts/ai-democracy|democratic]] [[thoughts/ai-governance|governance]] of artificial intelligence. My prior work has focused on related topics in multi-agent reinforcement learning and game theory.
