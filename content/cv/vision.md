Vibrant, thriving machine learning research and applications ecosystems where diverse pluralities of stakeholders collectively co-design, plan, build and share artificial intelligence tools that align with their values and sustainably meet humanity's needs.

# Principes 
While on sabbatical I wrote a lot of rants and manifestos (none of which I'd ever dream of publishing). I had plenty of critiques of the direction of the Artificial Intelligence™ industry, but it began to become clear just how directionless my own thinking had become. I knew what I was opposed to, but what was I *for*? Among other helpful voices, Kim Crayton's  [Guiding Principles](https://www.kimcrayton.com/guiding-principles/) offered a proactive toehold out of my terminal doomerism:
> 1. Tech is not neutral, nor is it apolitical
> 2. Intention without strategy is chaos
> 3. Lack of inclusion is a risk / crisis management issue
> 4. Prioritize the most vulnerable

# Values
From this foundation, I decided to roll my own list of values and associated principles to put them into action. I think of these as a both a decision aid and a sort of long-form promise to myself:

1. __Inclusivity__: Genuinely responsible AI requires intentional collaboration and participation across communities with diverse perspectives, backgrounds and experience.

2. __Egalitarianism__: Extreme concentrations of wealth, data and power undermine comprehensive alignment of AI with the values of the communities it impacts. Ensuring safe scaling of next generation AI systems necessitates proactive public engagement and democratic innovation.

3. __Dignity__: Researchers must work in solidarity with and prioritize the concerns of vulnerable parties directly impacted by the technologies we study to ensure the research questions we pose, data we utilize, and models we release into the world minimize exploitation and mitigate societal harm.

4. __Transparency__: Constantly strive to improve communication of results, research activities, strategic planning and decision making processes through open access publication, open source software and data sharing.

5. __Empowerment__: Foster virtual and physical spaces for collaborative knowledge sharing and discourse to empower individuals and communities to use emerging AI tools and actively participate in setting the course our technology pursues.
