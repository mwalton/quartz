The compost heap of random scraps of ideas I've been thinking about. Some are new, some are  old; some are being actively thought about, others have been digesting for a long time. If you are actively working on research that sounds related and are interested in a discussion or possible collaboration, please get in touch!

## Research
- Federated digital gardens
	- what if digital gardens + mastadon / activitypub?
- Democratic Reinforcement Learning:
	- liquid democracy game: delegation game; players have different private info, benefits each other in aggregate to delegate authority when other player has requisite private info
	- Comparative experiments using different voting schemes in MARL (quadratic etc.)
- theory of mind for language models
- narrative priors
- crowdfunded foundation models
## AI Institutional Design Experiments
- Participatory AI Unconference
	- **Objective**: experiments in democratic participatory design. All stages of the design process incorporate participation of diversity of stakeholders
	- **Methods**: Short talks + poster session idea jam, deliberative discourse sessions, proposal construction, election & sub-teaming, hackathon
	- **Deliverable(s)**: Publication + code for projects created + event metastudy incorporating participant survey, lessons learned, case study results
## Applications
(please feel free to steal; credit for inspiration is cool, collaboration is awesome. but ultimately I'd rather just see them be built and my time and attention is woefully finite 🥲)
- moodring: community care mental health support
	- emoji likert scale input
	- distributed average consensus (DAC) averages over social graph enables users to see the community "vibe" w/o centralized averages
	- mutual consent mechanism for giving / receiving care / "reaching out"
- MARL microgrids & meshnetworks
- Infinite forest: immersive generated VR forest
- **scrutinize.me**: The Contrarian Research Tool 😈 🎓 User begins with a claim, articles supporting & against. A language model plays “devils advocate”. argument lists w/ evidence articles supporting & against in two columns below. User updates a “confidence” slider to illustrate dunning-kruger effect. Inspired by: [Learning By Writing](https://www.cold-takes.com/learning-by-writing/)
	- “like a GAN for your hypotheses” - ai nerd
	- “i hate it” - prominent american politician
	- “stop stealing my dopamine” - terminally online debate bro
- misc digital mutual aid tools
	- virtual community fridge
	- toolshare / skillshare / laborshare tools and platforms
