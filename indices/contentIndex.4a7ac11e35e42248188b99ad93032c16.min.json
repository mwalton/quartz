Common methods for time series anomaly detection do not explicitly consider the goal-directed nature of rational agents. This work proposes a method for detection of anomalous behaviors based on agent intent formulated using agent-based Lagrangian Mechanics. We propose an anomaly detection method that simultaneously learns to 1) predict the intended goals of agents from their trajectories, and 2) detect anomalies based on the predictions. The method uses a structured one-class support vector machine (structured OC-SVM), where latent variables represent the intentions (goals) of agents, and SVM weights represent the attraction or repulsion strength of potential goals and obstructions. Model parameters are learned in an unsupervised way. We conduct experiments in a marine surveillance setting, where we monitor high-traffic ports and detect anomalous vessels. Experimental results show that our algorithm shows promise for detecting anomalous behaviors in systems of goal-directed agents.\n\n[paper](https://xuxie1031.github.io/resources/aaaiw19hung.pdf)","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T02:12:27.879659408Z","tags":null},"/cv/pubs/mdn-anom":{"title":"Unsupervised anomaly detection for digital radio frequency transmissions","content":"Michael Walton, Maurice Ayache, Logan Straatemeier, Daniel Gebhardt, Benjamin Migliori\n![[cv/pubs/images/rf.png]]\n\nWe present a novel method of unsupervised anomaly detection using long-short-term memory mixture density networks (LSTM-MDN), applied to timeseries data of digital radio transmissions. The modern radio frequency (RF) environment is a dynamic and ever-changing complex milieu of signals, environmental effects, unintentional interference, and intentional jamming. A consequence of this complex mix is that RF receivers must become better and better at rejecting anomalous signals in order to recover the transmitted information. However, it is not always possible to know a priori what constitutes a valid signal and what constitutes an anomaly (intentional or otherwise), especially with the adoption of cognitive radio techniques. We show that an LSTM-MDN model is able to rapidly learn the training set and produce probability distribution functions for the expected signal as a function of time. We then demonstrate that the negative log likelihood of an incoming test transmission, conditioned on the training set, provides a metric that allows anomalous signals to be detected and labeled. We demonstrate this method for eight popular modulations and for three different anomaly types. By applying unsupervised learning in the temporal domain, we report a fully-generalizable anomaly detection method that may be applied to signals for which the transmission parameters may be unknown or obscured.","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T02:12:27.879659408Z","tags":null},"/cv/pubs/mlo":{"title":"# Hunting for naval mines with deep neural networks","content":"Daniel Gebhardt, Keyur Parikh, Iryna Dzieciuch, Michael Walton, Nhut Anh Vo Hoang\n\n![[cv/pubs/images/mlo.png]]\n\nExplosive naval mines pose a threat to ocean and sea faring vessels, both military and civilian. This work applies deep neural network (DNN) methods to the problem of detecting minelike objects (MLO) on the seafloor in side-scan sonar imagery. We explored how the DNN depth, memory requirements, calculation requirements, and training data distribution affect detection efficacy. A visualization technique (class activation map) was incorporated that aids a user in interpreting the model's behavior. We found that modest DNN model sizes yielded better accuracy (98%) than very simple DNN models (93%) and a support vector machine (78%). The largest DNN models achieved \u003c;1% efficacy increase at a cost of a 17x increase of trainable parameter count and computation requirements. In contrast to DNNs popularized for many-class image recognition tasks, the models for this task require far fewer computational resources (0.3% of parameters), and are suitable for embedded use within an autonomous unmanned underwater vehicle.","lastmodified":"2023-04-06T02:12:27.879659408Z","tags":null},"/cv/pubs/rl-openspiel":{"title":"Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning in OpenSpiel: A Reproduction Report","content":"[paper](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation\u0026hl=en\u0026user=TTEHCqUAAAAJ\u0026citation_for_view=TTEHCqUAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC), [code](https://github.com/aicenter/openspiel_reproductions)\n\nMichael Walton, Viliam Lisy\n![[cv/pubs/images/rcfr_horz.png]]\nIn this report, we present results reproductions for several core algorithms implemented in the OpenSpiel framework for learning in games.

The primary contributions of this work are threefold: First, a formal definition of a computationally tractable mechanism for computing hand probabilities in Hanabi. Second, an extension to conventional Deep Reinforcement Learning that introduces reasoning over finitely nested theory of mind belief hierarchies. Finally, an intrinsic reward mechanism enabled by theory of mind that incentivizes agents to share strategically relevant private knowledge with their teammates.

The world is full of conflicts; and, overshadowing all minor conflicts, the titanic struggle between Communism and anti-Communism.\n\nAlmost everybody who is politically conscious has strong feelings about one or more of these issues; but we want you, if you can, to set aside such feelings and consider yourselves only as members of a biological species which has had a remarkable history, and whose disappearance none of us can desire.\n\nWe shall try to say no single word which should appeal to one group rather than to another. All, equally, are in peril, and, if the peril is understood, there is hope that they may collectively avert it.\n\nWe have to learn to think in a new way. We have to learn to ask ourselves, not what steps can be taken to give military victory to whatever group we prefer, for there no longer are such steps; the question we have to ask ourselves is: what steps can be taken to prevent a military contest of which the issue must be disastrous to all parties?\n\nThe general public, and even many men in positions of authority, have not realized what would be involved in a war with nuclear bombs. The general public still thinks in terms of the obliteration of cities. It is understood that the new bombs are more powerful than the old, and that, while one A-bomb could obliterate Hiroshima, one H-bomb could obliterate the largest cities, such as London, New York, and Moscow.\n\nNo doubt, in an H-bomb war, great cities would be obliterated. But this is one of the minor disasters that would have to be faced. If everybody in London, New York, and Moscow were exterminated, the world might, in the course of a few centuries, recover from the blow. But we now know, especially since the Bikini test, that nuclear bombs can gradually spread destruction over a very much wider area than had been supposed.\n\nIt is stated on very good authority that a bomb can now be manufactured which will be 2,500 times as powerful as that which destroyed Hiroshima. Such a bomb, if exploded near the ground or under water, sends radio-active particles into the upper air. They sink gradually and reach the surface of the earth in the form of a deadly dust or rain. It was this dust which infected the Japanese fishermen and their catch of fish. No one knows how widely such lethal radio-active particles might be diffused, but the best authorities are unanimous in saying that a war with H-bombs might possibly put an end to the human race. It is feared that if many H-bombs are used there will be universal death, sudden only for a minority, but for the majority a slow torture of disease and disintegration.\n\nMany warnings have been uttered by eminent men of science and by authorities in military strategy. None of them will say that the worst results are certain. What they do say is that these results are possible, and no one can be sure that they will not be realized. We have not yet found that the views of experts on this question depend in any degree upon their politics or prejudices. They depend only, so far as our researches have revealed, upon the extent of the particular expert‚Äôs knowledge. We have found that the men who know most are the most gloomy.\n\nHere, then, is the problem which we present to you, stark and dreadful and inescapable: Shall we put an end to the human race; or shall mankind renounce war? People will not face this alternative because it is so difficult to abolish war.\n\nThe abolition of war will demand distasteful limitations of national sovereignty. But what perhaps impedes understanding of the situation more than anything else is that the term ‚Äúmankind‚Äù feels vague and abstract. People scarcely realize in imagination that the danger is to themselves and their children and their grandchildren, and not only to a dimly apprehended humanity. They can scarcely bring themselves to grasp that they, individually, and those whom they love are in imminent danger of perishing agonizingly. And so they hope that perhaps war may be allowed to continue provided modern weapons are prohibited.\n\nThis hope is illusory. Whatever agreements not to use H-bombs had been reached in time of peace, they would no longer be considered binding in time of war, and both sides would set to work to manufacture H-bombs as soon as war broke out, for, if one side manufactured the bombs and the other did not, the side that manufactured them would inevitably be victorious.\n\nAlthough an agreement to renounce nuclear weapons as part of a general reduction of armaments would not afford an ultimate solution, it would serve certain important purposes. First, any agreement between East and West is to the good in so far as it tends to diminish tension. Second, the abolition of thermo-nuclear weapons, if each side believed that the other had carried it out sincerely, would lessen the fear of a sudden attack in the style of Pearl Harbour, which at present keeps both sides in a state of nervous apprehension. We should, therefore, welcome such an agreement though only as a first step.\n\nMost of us are not neutral in feeling, but, as human beings, we have to remember that, if the issues between East and West are to be decided in any manner that can give any possible satisfaction to anybody, whether Communist or anti-Communist, whether Asian or European or American, whether White or Black, then these issues must not be decided by war. We should wish this to be understood, both in the East and in the West.\n\nThere lies before us, if we choose, continual progress in happiness, knowledge, and wisdom. Shall we, instead, choose death, because we cannot forget our quarrels? We appeal as human beings to human beings: Remember your humanity, and forget the rest.
