I had plenty of critiques of the direction of the Artificial Intelligence‚Ñ¢ industry, but it began to become clear just how directionless my own thinking had become. I knew what I was opposed to, but what was I *for*? Thankfully, Kim Crayton offered a straightforward foothold that resonated with me in her [Guiding Principles](https://www.kimcrayton.com/guiding-principles/):\n\u003e 1. Tech is not neutral, nor is it apolitical\n\u003e 2. Intention without strategy is chaos\n\u003e 3. Lack of inclusion is a risk / crisis management issue\n\u003e 4. Prioritize the most vulnerable\n\nFrom this foundation, I decided to roll my own list of principles tuned toward present concerns around the societal impact of AI. I think of these as a both a decision aid and a sort of long-form promise to myself:\n\n1. __Inclusivity__: Genuinely responsible AI requires intentional collaboration between communities with diverse perspectives, backgrounds and experience.\n\n2. __Egalitarianism__: Extreme concentrations of wealth, data and power¬†undermine comprehensive alignment of AI with the values of the communities it impacts. Ensuring safe scaling of next generation AI systems necessitates proactive public engagement and democratic innovation.\n\n3. __Dignity__: Work in solidarity with and prioritize the concerns of vulnerable parties directly impacted by AI to ensure the research questions we pose, data we utilize, and models we release into the world minimize exploitation and mitigate societal harm.\n\n4. __Transparency__: Constantly strive to improve understandable communication of results, research activities, strategic planning and decision making processes through open access publication, open source software and data sharing.\n\n5. __Empowerment__: Foster virtual and physical spaces for collaborative knowledge sharing and discourse to empower individuals and communities to use emerging AI tools and actively participate in setting the course the technology pursues.","lastmodified":"2023-03-09T09:10:23.88567019Z","tags":null},"/cv/projects":{"title":"Projects","content":"This is a list of notable projects and publications I've worked on.

Definitions vary (and often stewardship implys some form of development) but for our purposes we'll follow the wikipedia-level defintion and refer to *development* as 'changing landforms from a natural or semi-natural state for a purpose, such as agriculture or housing'. \n\nStewardship, however is more nuanced. Its definition varys in different contexts but the unifying theme is *caring* for a piece of land, regardless of its ownership. Caring about all the biodiverse species that belong to the land; its people, their culture and their customs.\n\nSimilarly, in the virtual world, the language technologists use to describe the roles we play and the methods we use are a reflection of our values. Today, the art and science of creating software artifacts is carried out primarily under the title *[developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhh_GeBPOhs\u0026ab_channel=MrWueb007)*.\n\nContrary to corporate technologists‚Äô obsession with unfettered growth, development and disruption; what might it look like to _care_ for health of the planetary cyberphysical system our technologies shape?
