Common methods for time series anomaly detection do not explicitly consider the goal-directed nature of rational agents. This work proposes a method for detection of anomalous behaviors based on agent intent formulated using agent-based Lagrangian Mechanics. We propose an anomaly detection method that simultaneously learns to 1) predict the intended goals of agents from their trajectories, and 2) detect anomalies based on the predictions. The method uses a structured one-class support vector machine (structured OC-SVM), where latent variables represent the intentions (goals) of agents, and SVM weights represent the attraction or repulsion strength of potential goals and obstructions. Model parameters are learned in an unsupervised way. We conduct experiments in a marine surveillance setting, where we monitor high-traffic ports and detect anomalous vessels. Experimental results show that our algorithm shows promise for detecting anomalous behaviors in systems of goal-directed agents.\n\n[paper](https://xuxie1031.github.io/resources/aaaiw19hung.pdf)","lastmodified":"2023-03-13T21:08:43.057242336Z","tags":null},"/cv/pubs/mdn-anom":{"title":"Unsupervised anomaly detection for digital radio frequency transmissions","content":"Michael Walton, Maurice Ayache, Logan Straatemeier, Daniel Gebhardt, Benjamin Migliori\n![[cv/pubs/images/rf.png]]\nWe present a novel method of unsupervised anomaly detection using long-short-term memory mixture density networks (LSTM-MDN), applied to timeseries data of digital radio transmissions. The modern radio frequency (RF) environment is a dynamic and ever-changing complex milieu of signals, environmental effects, unintentional interference, and intentional jamming. A consequence of this complex mix is that RF receivers must become better and better at rejecting anomalous signals in order to recover the transmitted information. However, it is not always possible to know a priori what constitutes a valid signal and what constitutes an anomaly (intentional or otherwise), especially with the adoption of cognitive radio techniques. We show that an LSTM-MDN model is able to rapidly learn the training set and produce probability distribution functions for the expected signal as a function of time. We then demonstrate that the negative log likelihood of an incoming test transmission, conditioned on the training set, provides a metric that allows anomalous signals to be detected and labeled. We demonstrate this method for eight popular modulations and for three different anomaly types. By applying unsupervised learning in the temporal domain, we report a fully-generalizable anomaly detection method that may be applied to signals for which the transmission parameters may be unknown or obscured.","lastmodified":"2023-03-13T21:08:43.057242336Z","tags":null},"/cv/pubs/mlo":{"title":"# Hunting for naval mines with deep neural networks","content":"Daniel Gebhardt, Keyur Parikh, Iryna Dzieciuch, Michael Walton, Nhut Anh Vo Hoang\n![[cv/pubs/images/mlo.png]]\nExplosive naval mines pose a threat to ocean and sea faring vessels, both military and civilian. This work applies deep neural network (DNN) methods to the problem of detecting minelike objects (MLO) on the seafloor in side-scan sonar imagery. We explored how the DNN depth, memory requirements, calculation requirements, and training data distribution affect detection efficacy. A visualization technique (class activation map) was incorporated that aids a user in interpreting the model's behavior. We found that modest DNN model sizes yielded better accuracy (98%) than very simple DNN models (93%) and a support vector machine (78%). The largest DNN models achieved \u003c;1% efficacy increase at a cost of a 17x increase of trainable parameter count and computation requirements. In contrast to DNNs popularized for many-class image recognition tasks, the models for this task require far fewer computational resources (0.3% of parameters), and are suitable for embedded use within an autonomous unmanned underwater vehicle.","lastmodified":"2023-03-13T21:08:43.057242336Z","tags":null},"/cv/pubs/rl-openspiel":{"title":"Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning in OpenSpiel: A Reproduction Report","content":"[paper](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation\u0026hl=en\u0026user=TTEHCqUAAAAJ\u0026citation_for_view=TTEHCqUAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC), [code](https://github.com/aicenter/openspiel_reproductions)\n\nMichael Walton, Viliam Lisy\n![[cv/pubs/images/rcfr_horz.png]]\nIn this report, we present results reproductions for several core algorithms implemented in the OpenSpiel framework for learning in games.

In this work, we propose a mechanism for imbuing Reinforcement Learning agents with a theory of mind to discover efficient cooperative strategies in Hanabi. The primary contributions of this work are threefold: First, a formal definition of a computationally tractable mechanism for computing hand probabilities in Hanabi. Second, an extension to conventional Deep Reinforcement Learning that introduces reasoning over finitely nested theory of mind belief hierarchies. Finally, an intrinsic reward mechanism enabled by theory of mind that incentivizes agents to share strategically relevant private knowledge with their teammates. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithm against Rainbow, a state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning agent.\n\n[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09328), [code](https://github.com/mwalton/ToM-hanabi-neurips19)","lastmodified":"2023-03-13T21:08:43.057242336Z","tags":null},"/cv/vision":{"title":"Vision","content":"A vibrant, thriving machine learning research and applications ecosystem where a diverse plurality of stakeholders collectively codesign, plan, build and share artificial intelligence tools that align with their vaules and sustainibly meet their needs.\n\n# Principes \nWhile on sabbatical I wrote alot of rants and manifestos (none of which I'd ever dream of publishing).
